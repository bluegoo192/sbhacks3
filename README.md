# Apt-get (name subject to change)
Apt-get is a map based tool for finding houses/apartments to rent.  It supports advanced queries and is easy to use.

## Features
* Filter by custom area: you can lasso a custom area to show the stats of homes in that area.  This allows you to view information on homes in a highly specific region, like a particular part of a particular street.
* Many, many custom criteria: you can filter homes by any combination specific needs.  Need an apartment that allows pets, has tile floors, and allows smoking?  We've got you covered
* Visual sorting: view homes by location while also sorting by price, number of bedrooms, user rating, and more
* Detailed information about each property: check a building's age, quality of internet access, subleasing policy, and more right from our apt-get -- no need to navigate through different property manager websites
* More coming soon!

## Tech we use
* Node
* Express
* Vue

### Note: apt-get is in development does not currently use real data. Do not use it for real world rental-finding yet, because all the data is fake
